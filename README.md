**Currently working on movement-**
1. Added moving left and right with seperated ground and air deceleration
2. added a single jump with gravity
3. added a simple dash with tech to increase dash distance when pressing the jump key before/at the same time (probably going to check for it to be before like D2 icarus dash)
4. Need to add/figure out how i want to add in Sword swipe movement. Probably want to be able to sword swipe once in the air with increased distance, and be able to swipe again after some time for a decreased distance.
pressing jump after will allow you to get increased horizontal distance out of sword swipe
